            It is my pleasure to present {BOOK_TITLE}, a teaching resource created to support undergraduate
            learners in their academic journey of developing confident and purposeful communication.
            This book is shaped by over twenty years of my personal experience in teaching English
            at all levels, as well as by long-term observation of B1 learners&apos; study styles,
            interaction patterns, educational challenges and academic progress within a higher
            education context.
          </p>
          <p>
            This teaching resource is closely aligned with Common European Framework of References (CEFR) B1
            descriptors as well as well-informed by the Cambridge TKT framework, ensuring
            internationally relevant, sound and state-of-the-art methodology. Moreover, it reflects
            core TESOL and ELT principles, including strong reliance on communicative language
            teaching, task-based learning, learner autonomy, and reflective practice based on
            critical thinking tasks. Altogether, these principles are applied in a practical,
            student-centred classroom approach, allowing students to engage actively with language
            rather than learn it theoretically.
          </p>
          <p>
            Listening, reading, speaking, and writing skills are equally integrated into each unit
            so that skills develop simultaneously. In addition, each language input in the units is
            immediately followed by a meaningful output, helping learners build a balanced focus on
            fluency and accuracy at the same time. Topical vocabulary, idioms, proverbs and
            functional language are presented in level-specific context as well as recycled through
            various tasks to encourage classroom engagement and real-world language use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Texts and Listening activities are based on exposure to authentic, native-speaker
            sources, offering natural language in real academic and social communication samples.
            There is a particular focus on Critical Thinking and Academic Writing that are carefully
            scaffolded to guide students with step-by-step coherent writings:
            punctuation/capitalization rules → topic/supporting/concluding sentences → paragraphs →
            academic essays.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, the teaching resource creates modern learning environments, suggesting
            thoughtful use of multiple digital resources and global online study platforms. Selected
            educational AI tools are used ethically only as supportive aids for feedback and layout,
            with full respect for academic integrity and copyright. Here, technology is used to
            enhance learning, not to replace it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, this book is flexible, student-centred and teacher-friendly, due to its
            easy adaptability to different institutional contexts and diverse teaching and learning
            styles. I sincerely hope that this book will achieve its main goal and help learners
            use academic English with confidence and a clear sense of purpose, while making the
            learning process more engaging, enjoyable, and meaningful for both students and
            teachers.
